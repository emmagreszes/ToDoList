# ToDoList

This To do List organizes your task in a clear way that separates them based on topic. 
There will be several pages (for example: school, work, health, finance etc.).
Each page will display the that you need to do within that category.
Each page will have an option to add a new task. 
For each task there is a title, due date and time to complete.
When a task is completed, there is an option to remove.
